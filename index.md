# DigiblockSim

A digital electronic editor and simulator for learning. Its local web based and we still working on it.

Use Verilog files to create new Blocks and combine together with wires or buses. Moreover you have special Blocks like Control-Block or diferents input/outputs Blocks.

Next you can export it to an FPGA, or simulate it. We used [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) for this purpose.
